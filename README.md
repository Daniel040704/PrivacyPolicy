#### Data processed by the bot:

* User identifier (e.g. `#DanyloF`)

Each user can access **only their own data**.

#### Secrets Protection

All access tokens, API keys, and credentials (including Telegram bot tokens and Firebase keys) are securely stored using **Firebase Secret Manager**.

### **6. User Control Over Data**

Users have full control over their data:

Each service operates under its own privacy policy.
